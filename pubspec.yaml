  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/locale/
    - assets/json/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/lottie/

    - assets/locale/localization_en.json

    - assets/images/logos/gofuel_logo.jpeg
    - assets/images/logos/gozap_small_color_logo.png
    - assets/images/logos/gozap_large_white_logo.png
    - assets/images/logos/gozap_smaill_white_bg_logo.png
    - assets/images/bg/gozap_small_banner.png
    - assets/images/bg/gozap_large_banner.png
    - assets/images/personal_info_profile.png
    
    - assets/lottie/registered_lottie.json
    - assets/lottie/logged_in_lottie.json
    - assets/lottie/recharged_lottie.json
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GoZAPPIcon 
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/gozap_icons.ttf
        - asset: fonts/icomoon.ttf
        
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
